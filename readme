## Overview

This is a 2 player game which involves players rolling the dice until or holding their scores until one person reaches 20. However, if a 1 is rolled, the current player's score is returned to 0, and the next player becomes the current player.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was the most complex project that I've worked on until now, and it was very rewarding to finally see it working. I learned how to break down the game logic in to steps, inorder to understand what needs to be done, and how it should be done. This project used a bit more complex Javascript and I thoroughly enjoyed googling until I found some assistance on StackOverflow.

See a code snippet below:

```js
if (scores[activePlayer] >= 20) {
  playing = false; //playing === false so btns will not work
  diceEl.classList.add('hidden');
  document
    .querySelector(`.player--${activePlayer}`)
    .classList.add('player--winner');
  document
    .querySelector(`.player--${activePlayer}`)
    .classList.remove('player--active');
} else {
  // 3. if 100 finish the game
  // 4. if not switch to next player
  switchPlayer();
}
```
